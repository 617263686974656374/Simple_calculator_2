# Simple_calculator_2
This Java application serves as a basic calculator that allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on integers and floating-point numbers.
Users interact with a console-based menu to select the type of arithmetic operation they want to perform. The program supports handling decimal inputs and ensures appropriate arithmetic operations are applied based on the input type.

## Features
- **Support for Multiple Data Types**: Handles both integer and double precision floating-point numbers.
- **Dynamic Operation Menu**: Offers a choice of operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with the option to exit the program.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the user inputs are valid numbers and handles exceptions gracefully, prompting the user to correct their input.
- **Division by Zero Handling**: Specifically checks for and handles attempts to divide by zero, prompting the user to re-enter a valid divisor.

## Usage Instructions
- Upon running the program, you will see a menu with options to choose different arithmetic operations or to exit.
- Select the operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
- Input the first and second numbers as prompted. The program handles both integers and floating-point numbers.
- After the operation, the result will be displayed. You can then choose another operation or exit the program.

## Example
```
[1] plus
[2] minus
[3] multiply
[4] divide
[5] exit Program
Enter [index] of your choice: 1
Enter the first number please: 5.5
Enter the second number please: 4.5
